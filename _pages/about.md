I’m Seunghun Baek, a third-year integrated MSc/PhD student in the [Medical Information Processing Lab](https://mip.postech.ac.kr) at POSTECH, supervised by [Dr. Won Hwa Kim](https://wwplato.github.io).
My research focuses on learning representations in data-efficient ways, with a particular interest in signal processing.
I am especially interested in applying these methods to real-world medical scenarios, particularly those involving the human brain.

#### Research Interest

<ul>
 <li>Computer Vision & Machine Learning</li>
 <li>Representation Learning</li>
 <li>Data Efficient Learning</li>
 <li>Medical Imaging (Brain) </li>
</ul>
